                                FEW DAY, NEW HOPE, NEW LIFE” Our motto suggests that hopes should never be underestimated, they should be transformed into dreams; dreams that turn into reality! Hopes let you live through darkness and make you believe that there is light beyond defeat and Dreams teach you that to accomplish big goals, we must act, work hard, and show perseverance. The idea came up as I wanted to help people not out of sympathy but love, care, and affection. Charity, in order to get fame and funds, was not my motive, instead, the smiles on their faces. I appreciate and feel blessed to have all the necessary privileges and wanted to share them with the people in need around me. I wanted to stand and initiate a remarkable project that brings out a revolutionary change in the helping culture of our society. I believe people like urban slum dwellers, tea-vendors, laborers, dishwashers, and so forth should be uplifted and made self- reliant for the betterment of society. Therefore, I decided to take this innovative step towards solving the problem of hunger, water, nutrition, etc.  I had started this family with 5 members back on 23rd August 2019. I had the complete support of my family and friends. Being college students, we were lacking funds. Yet our intentions were sharp and clear. In the first instance, we were able to gather a sum of ₹1000. Each one of us had contributed a small portion of our pocket money into our first drive. We gathered courage and were wholly prepared for this. Our initial service included distributing fruits and other refreshments to around 50 people. It was a bit challenging and diligent. Slowly and gradually, our family started expanding. We made our Instagram handle along with spreading our lengths and breadths through word of mouth. People started understanding our agendas and approached us in every possible way.

                            I feel the youth of the country is a game-changer. They are the building blocks and their values shape society. We as youngsters hold the power and great role in determining the future of our country. Also, according to me, the unequal distribution of income is the persistent cause of increasing Poverty. The widespread concern of this problem has not been fairly shared, and that this economic crisis has only widened the gulf between the rich and the poor. 

                            </p>

                            During the Pandemic, we have done our best and have been on our toes to help the needy people. Our major concern was maintaining the safety and security of the migrants so that the spread of the virus is reduced. We have distributed 2500+ masks on the highway and within the city as well. We made them understand the seriousness of this devastating human enemy. Our team members had also reached out to the borders of the city and distributed edible and safety material to the migrants. We organized the ration to the needy strictly under the guidelines of Covid-19. 
The next big step was "Project Makeover" where we helped 3 people make a living. Through this project, we aim to provide a little help to small scale business holders in terms of money as well as material. This helped them increase their stock as well as sales. 'Chai Chowk' was the very first stall we helped to build. Then two stalls named 'Mahendra ki rasoi' and 'Dadi ka Dhaba'. 'Dadi ka Dhaba' went viral and reached 40k views on Instagram.

                            </P>

                            We organize ‘Sunday Langars’ in our neighborhood where we distribute different meals to 700 people every Sunday. We also distributed 100 blankets in winter 2019 and reached 500 blankets in winter 2020.
I have seen our venture growing with the love and blessings of every single person. My ultimate aim is to turn this small step into a combined home for the old age people as well as orphans; so that they could enjoy the company of each other. Old age is a reflection of childhood. People at this age are hungry for care, love, and wish to spend this phase of life with their grandchildren or near and dear ones. On the other hand, children who are devoid of parental love can find a healthy livelihood and childhood with these people. We are doing our best to make this a big success in the next 5 years. My major source of motivation to go an extra mile for such deeds is my mother along with my friends that have remained constant throughout. We at Hopes & Dreams maintain healthy relationships and a friendly environment. We always hold a prior discussion before each and every drive. 
This has been my story so far, full of hundreds of beautiful happy faces.

                            I believe helping is a human nature that lies within the hearts of all. Luxuries are not necessities but compassion and humanity are. The purpose of life is to render our services in any way we can to people that live around us, with us, and most essentially to the people who need us. There is grace in everything on earth but amongst all Humanity remains the queen. Be helpful and kind to everyone to see and meet, it might enlighten them to do the same and if it happened this world would be a wonderful place to live in.”
